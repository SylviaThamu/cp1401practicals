# Logic Exercise

Smith is the project manager.
Jones is the consultant.
Brown is the programmer.

Explanation:
- The programmer is an only child.
- Smith married Brownâ€™s sister, so Brown is not an only child.
- That means Brown cannot be the programmer.
- Smith earns more money than the consultant, so Smith is not the consultant.
- Therefore, Smith must be the project manager.
- That leaves Jones as the consultant and Brown as the programmer.
