Logic Exercise

The fewest number of socks you must take to be sure to get a pair of the same colour is 3.

Explanation:
There are only two colours: black and white.
If you pick 1 black and 1 white sock, you still have no pair.
But if you pick one more sock (the 3rd sock), it must match either black or white.
Thus, 3 socks guarantee a pair of the same colour.
